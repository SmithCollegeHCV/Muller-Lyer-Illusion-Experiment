<p>You are being asked to be in a research study on interactive data analysis because you have selected
this HIT on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The purpose of the study is to investigate how people analyze
changing data using an interactive visualization. The results of this study will help improve
visualizations in the future. Please read the following before agreeing to be in the study. If you agree
to be in this study, you be shown a visualization of streaming data and be asked to monitor each data
stream for different kinds of patterns. When you observe a pattern, you will indicate the type of
pattern by pressing the corresponding key on your keyboard. Respond to each pattern as quickly and
accurately as possible. After you are done with the main study, you will be asked to complete a brief
questionnaire. Participation in this study should take about <strong>15 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>There are no known risks or direct benefits to you for completing this study. You will receive $1 for
participating in this study. In addition, for each correct response you will receive $0.10, and you will
receive a bonus of $0.25 for correctly identifying all the patterns. Your responses will be strictly
anonymous. They may be used in research papers and academic presentations.
The decision to participate in this study is entirely up to you. You may refuse to take part in the study
at any time without affecting your relationship with the investigators of this study or Smith College.
Your decision will not result in any loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the
right not to answer any single question, as well as to withdraw completely from the interview at any
point during the process; additionally, you have the right to request that the interviewer not use any
of your interview material.</p>

<p>You have the right to ask questions about this research study and to have those questions answered
by me before, during or after the research. If you have any further questions about the study, at any
