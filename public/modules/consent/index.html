<p>You are being asked to be in a research study on Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) because you have selected this HIT on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The purpose of the study is to investigate how people use one kind of VAS (sliders) to select particular values and how their performance is affected by the way the slider looks. The results of this study will help improve the design of VASs in the future. Please read the following before agreeing to be in the study. If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to select 6 specific values using 6 different interactive sliders using either your mouse or touchscreen. Select each value by positioning the slider as accurately as possible. After you are done with the main study, you will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire. Participation in this study should take about <strong>15 minutes</strong>.</p>

<p>There are no known risks or direct benefits to you for completing this study. You will receive $0.25 for participating in this study. In addition, for each correct response you will receive a bonus of $0.10. Your responses will be strictly anonymous. They may be used in research papers and academic presentations.</p>
